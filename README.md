# odin-recipes

This is the my first project that I've completed on odin.
How to:-
I've used git to clone the required repo
Used my understanding from the previous lessons to solve this project
The website is about recipes, basically this is not so flashy website but simple with three relative links to other recipe pages.
I hope to get reviewed by others
