  <p>Tasty, juicy, and tender Turkish chicken kebabs start with a flavorful, Greek yogurt-based marinade. With this recipe, "Even inexperienced grillers can produce impressive results," says Chef John. "I'm not sure how 'Turkish' this is--it's loosely based on a lamb marinade I've used for a long time." </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>1 cup whole-milk Greek yogurt</li>
    <li>6 cloves garlic, minced</li>
    <li>2 tablespooms olive oil</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons freshly sequeezed lemon juice, or more to taste</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons ketchup/li>
    <li>1 tablespoon Aleppo red pepper flakes</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon kosher salt</li>
    <li>1½ tablespoon ground cumin</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
    <li>⅛ teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
    <li>2½ pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs, halved</li>
    <li>long metal skewers</li>
    </ul>


    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <dl>
        <dt><strong>Step 1</strong></dt>
        <dd>Whisk yogurt, garlic, olive oil, lemon juice, ketchup, red pepper flakes, salt, cumin, black pepper, paprika, and cinnamon together in a large bowl. </dd>
        <dt><strong>Step 2</strong></dt>
        <dd>Place chicken thigh halves into the yogurt marinade and coat them thoroughly on all sides. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate, 2 to 8 hours. </dd>
        <dt><strong>Step 3</strong></dt>
        <dd>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate. </dd>
        <dt><strong>Step 4</strong></dt>
        <dd>Using 2 skewers for each kebab, thread half of the chicken thighs onto each pair of skewers making a fairly thick "log" shape. </dd>
        <dt><strong>Step 5</strong></dt>
        <dd>Place kebabs on the preheated grill. Do not try to turn them until they begin to unstick from the grill, 3 or 4 minutes. Turn kebabs and grill the other side for 3 to 4 minutes. Continue cooking and turning until chicken is no longer pink in the center, about 6 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</dd>
