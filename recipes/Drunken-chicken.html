  <p>Here's a simple beer-can grilled chicken that adds Italian dressing to the mix. Give the cook half of the beer, then fill the can back up with Italian dressing. The can will be the stand for the chicken, keeping the bird upright so it cooks uniformly. "Oh wow! What a super chicken!" raves Linda McLean. "No fuss, no muss. After coating the chicken with the mustard, I also seasoned the outside and inside with garlic and onion powder and some black pepper. We stood it on the pan threw it on the grill and two hours later we had a golden juicy bird just begging to be enjoyed." </p>
